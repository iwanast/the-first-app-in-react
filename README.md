Hyper Island - The First App Module - Brief 2

📂 The Brief:
Refactoring brief one which was in JavaScript with react. It should be readable and maintainable. Publish the project.

⏳ Time spent / Deadline:
One week 

🎯 Goal:
Refactoring the earlier project with react.js and through this learning the basics of this library. 

🦾 The working process:
First I had to learn the basics of react and worked with function components, Hook, react router dom and react player.
Then I used create react app to set up the project, included SASS, react-router-dom, react-player and deleted the content under src. 
I implemented step for step the functions and logic from my previouse project and adapted where needed the fetch for the Sveriges Radio API. Then I published the project to netlify. 

🎧 The projects content:
I created a webbpage where all the programs from the swedish radio API (Sveriges Radio API) for children are. You can switch between programes for 3-8 year olds or programs for 9-13 year olds. If you click on a program, all available episodes (max 120) are shown. You then can click on the episode you want to play to get to the audioplayer.
